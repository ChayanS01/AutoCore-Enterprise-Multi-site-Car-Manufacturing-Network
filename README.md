# AutoCore-Enterprise-Multi-site-Car-Manufacturing-Network
A complete IPv4-based enterprise network for a car manufacturing company with HQ, a manufacturing plant, and a dealership site. I implemented VLANs, OSPF for inter-site routing, HSRP, EtherChannel for redundancy, port security, ACLs, DHCP/DNS/NAT services. This project demonstrates all major CCNA concepts in one real-world automotive environment.
